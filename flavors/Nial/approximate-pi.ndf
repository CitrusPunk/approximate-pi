 % REQUIREMENTS 
 % A Nial compiler
 % USAGE
 % Download the Nial compiler from https://www.nial-array-language.org/download/
 % Execute the program via 'nial -defs approximate-pi.ndf'

rnd := read 'Seed between 0.0 and 1.0: ';
iterations := read 'Amount of iterations: ';
seed rnd;
x gets random iterations;
y gets random iterations;
distances gets sqrt ((x * x) + (y * y));
in_circle gets sum(distances <= 1.0);
pi_approximation gets 4.0 * (in_circle / iterations);
write pi_approximation;
