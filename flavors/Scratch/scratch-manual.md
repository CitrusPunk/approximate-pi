## Run Scratch

Scratch is a block-based programming language that allows users to create interactive stories, games, and animations. If you've downloaded a .sb3 file and want to run it on scratch.mit.edu, here's how to do it:

1. First, open your web browser and navigate to the [Scratch Editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/).
3. Once you're in the Scratch editor, click on the "File" menu in the upper left-hand corner of the screen.
4. From the "File" menu, select "Load from your computer".
5. If you selected "Load from your computer", navigate to the location where you saved the .sb3 file and select it.
7. Once you've selected your .sb3 file, it will open in the Scratch editor.
8. To run the project, click on the green flag icon in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.

The project will now run in the Scratch player.
That's it! Now you know how to open and run a .sb3 file on Scratch.mit.edu.
