# Approximate-Pi

This project implements a approximation of Pi in several different programming languages.  
This is done with the [Monte Carlo Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) which roughly places random points on a plane and checks if they are inside or outside of that circle.

The implementations are located in flavors/[LANGUAGE_NAME]. The source code of each language contains the requirements and instructions on how to execute the implementation.


An unofficial goal of this project is to have all the letters of the alphabet represented in the initial letters of the [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages#E) **(22/26)**.
All languages make a total of **36** right now - may we reach 50 some day.

## Disclaimer

Those implementations are neither comparable nor should they show benchmarks of any programming language the algorithm was implemented with. I try to keep the implementation as simple as possible. The files might not satisfy best practices of the used programming language - improvements suggestions are welcome though. Moreover, it is debatable whether each language used can be called a programming language on its own. 

## To Do
 - Parallelize Mojo implementation to optiomize functionality and highlight differences to python
 - [Orc](https://orc.csres.utexas.edu/)
 - [Emojicode](https://www.emojicode.org/docs/)
 - [Etoys](http://www.squeakland.org/)
